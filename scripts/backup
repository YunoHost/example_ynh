### N.B. : the following 'ynh_backup' calls are only a *declaration* of what needs
### to be backuped and not an actual copy of any file. The actual backup that
### creates and fills the archive with the files happens in the core after this
### script is called. Hence ynh_backups calls take basically 0 seconds to run.

# BACKUP THE APP MAIN DIR
#=================================================

# BACKUP THE DATA DIR
#=================================================

# Only relevant if there is a "data_dir" resource for this app
# NB: $data_dir is not backuped during safety-backup-before-upgrades,
# because the data dir may be huge and we don't want to just yolo-create a 10+ GB archive just for upgrades.
# On the other hand, $data_dir is also *not* removed by default in the "app remove" step unless --purge is used
# This means that even if the upgrade fails and the backup is restored, the data are still there.

# BACKUP SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
#=================================================

# Backup the PHP-FPM configuration

# Backup the NGINX configuration

# Backup the systemd service unit
ynh_backup "/etc/systemd/system/$app.service"

# Backup the logrotate configuration
ynh_backup "/etc/logrotate.d/$app"

# Backup the Fail2Ban config
ynh_backup "/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/$app.conf"
ynh_backup "/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/$app.conf"

#=================================================
# BACKUP VARIOUS FILES
#=================================================

ynh_backup "/etc/cron.d/$app"

ynh_backup "/etc/$app/"

# NB: /var/log is not backuped during safety-backup-before-upgrades, same as $data_dir

# BACKUP THE MYSQL DATABASE
#=================================================
