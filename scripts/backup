### N.B. : the following 'ynh_backup' calls are only a *declaration* of what needs
### to be backuped and not an actual copy of any file. The actual backup that
### creates and fills the archive with the files happens in the core after this
### script is called. Hence ynh_backups calls take basically 0 seconds to run.

# BACKUP THE APP MAIN DIR
#=================================================

# BACKUP THE DATA DIR
#=================================================

# Only relevant if there is a "data_dir" resource for this app
# NB: $data_dir is not backuped during safety-backup-before-upgrades,
# because the data dir may be huge and we don't want to just yolo-create a 10+ GB archive just for upgrades.
# On the other hand, $data_dir is also *not* removed by default in the "app remove" step unless --purge is used
# This means that even if the upgrade fails and the backup is restored, the data are still there.
